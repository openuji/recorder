/**
 * Fuses the three independent CDP sources into one ordered domain event stream.
 *
 * Two things here are the whole design:
 *
 *  1. **One transport.** All three sources attach to the transport the host
 *     owns, so they share one connection; this function never closes it.
 *  2. **One FIFO queue, fed synchronously.** Each source emits from inside its
 *     CDP event handler straight into a single queue. The transport delivers
 *     events in arrival order and synchronously, so the order events reach the
 *     engine is exactly the order they arrived from Chromium — by construction.
 *     That ordering *is* the fusion: rules are written as "capture the next
 *     compositor frame after this lifecycle notification" and "the resting
 *     frame before this click". Any per-stream buffering, priority, or
 *     round-robin merge would silently capture different moments.
 *
 * The sources are the same `attach*` functions the standalone streams run, and
 * what they emit already are domain events, so a source watched in isolation
 * yields exactly what it feeds the engine here.
